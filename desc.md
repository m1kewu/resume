About Us
At Resilience, we’re creating a new category that integrates cybersecurity, cyber insurance, and cyber risk management.

Founded in 2016 by experts from across the highest tiers of the US military and intelligence communities – and built by prominent leaders and innovators from the insurance, technology, and cybersecurity industries – Resilience is rewriting the rules of how cyber risk is assessed, measured, and managed. Our integrated cyber risk solutions connect risk quantification software, cybersecurity experts, and A+ rated cyber insurance, all purpose-built for middle and large organizations. 

Guided strongly by our mission and four core values - transparency, excellence, grit, and humility, our culture uniquely blends many different backgrounds, experiences, and skills from across industries and geographies - all focused on helping our clients and partners stay ahead of the bad guys. We are a cybersecurity company, a Cyber and Tech E&O-focused MGA, a fintech startup, and a data science powerhouse, all purposefully built into one. 

Resilience is proud to be backed by leading technology investment firms, including General Catalyst, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Intact Ventures, Founders Fund, CRV, and Shield Capital. With headquarters in San Francisco, Resilience’s team is globally dispersed, with offices in New York, Chicago, Baltimore, Los Angeles, Toronto, and London. Resilience offers insurance coverage through its licensed and appointed insurance agents and security services through its expert security team.
